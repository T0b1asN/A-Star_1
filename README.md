# A-Star_1
A*-Test 1
Just a little Test of an Pathfindingalgorithm.
Completely free to use, CC0, you can use it, which doesn't mean, you should. :)
It doesn't even work right now and it will not be the fastest A*-implementation. 

## Instructions
To use the application, you need to locate a folder res, located in a folder in the folder of the executable.
There you can put the image, that needs solving.
After you have done that, you can open the executable, where you type the name of the picture,
with extension. After that, you state, wether diagonal movement is allowed or not.

## Restrictions of the image
First of all, the larger, the slower.
100 by 100 works, but it needs up to about 15 seconds.
The start should be marked in green, the end in red. Non-passable tiles should be black.
It doesn't matter, if you have more than 1 start or more than one finish.
The program chooses the first start and the last end it finds.
