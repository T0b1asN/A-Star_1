# A-Star_1
A*-Test 1
Just a little Test of an Pathfindingalgorithm.
Completely free to use, CC0, you can use it, which doesn't mean, you should. :)
It doesn't even work right now and it will not be the fastest A*-implementation. 

##Markdown-Test
This is also my 3rd project on GitHub, so I'm fairly new to this stuff, like a markdown-Readme, so I test it a bit. :)
